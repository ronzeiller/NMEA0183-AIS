= NMEA2000 -> NMEA0183 converter with AIS =

NMEA2000ToNMEA0183AIS

NMEA0183/NMEA2000 library. NMEA2000 -> NMEA0183 including AIS TYPE 1, CLASS A

 NMEA2000ToNMEA0183 Example taken from Timo Lappalainen
 Extended for AIS Encoding by Ronnie Zeiller


   Reads some messages from NMEA2000 and converts them to NMEA0183
   format to NMEA0183_out (Serial on Arduino or /dev/tnt0 on RPi).
   Also forwards all NMEA2000 bus messages in Actisense format.

 To use this example you need install also:

   - NMEA2000 library

   - NMEA0183 library

   - Related CAN libraries.

 This example works with ESP32 MCU Kit from AZ-Delivery which should be a 1:1 clone from Espressif 32 Kit
